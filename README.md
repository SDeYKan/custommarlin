Personal projects or things I struggled with.

-Here I will upload whatever code-related issues I had and what I did to solve them in case I have to go back in any moment or if anyone having a hard time finds this, you are free to use it.
Please notice i'm a novice and my stuff might bring errors, also, what I upload here is what works for me but you might be looking for something different.
